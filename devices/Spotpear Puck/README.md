## Spotpear “Puck”

Meet the Spotpear **“Puck”**—my nickname for this compact, wearable device. The Puck runs on the same firmware and shares the hardware and pin layout as Ball v2, so you can expect use same code.

> **Tip:**
> If you’re planning to use your Puck for hands-free “walk and talk” situations, keep in mind that the touchscreen can be a bit sensitive. When the display brushes against your shirt, it might accidentally start or stop a conversation.
>
> The good news? If your Puck features a touchscreen and you primarily want to use it while walking, you can simply disable the touch functionality right in the ESPHome code for a smoother, interruption-free experience.
