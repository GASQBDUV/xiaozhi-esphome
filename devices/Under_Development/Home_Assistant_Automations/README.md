# 📂 Home Assistant Automations

> *Automations I use or experiment with. **Remember to change entity and device names to your own.***

1. `switch_voiceassist.yaml` — Talk to `<assistant>` (dynamic voice-agent switching by voice)**
   Say things like “**talk to Jarvis**” or “**let me talk to Harley Quinn**,” and the automation will switch the assistant/pipeline on your voice satellite **on the fly**. It reads the available options from your `select` entity at runtime, so you **don’t have to edit the Automation** when you add or rename assistants.

2. `response_light.yaml` — Sample automation to turn the little led on in the balls when the assistant is thinking (or responding if you wish) by rchiileea
