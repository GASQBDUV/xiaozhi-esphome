### ‚ö†Ô∏è Please Note

* This code is **under active development** as I continue to add features and expand device support.
  *Think of it as a **beta** version!*
* The default code examples for each device (found in the other directories) are stable, working examples with a basic setup. These are **unlikely to change**.
* If you run into issues, **always try the default code for your device first.**


Change settings as needed and remember to keep your own "name" and "friendly_name", then install.
